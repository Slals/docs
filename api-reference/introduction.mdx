## Welcome to the Stan API Documentation section

In this page you'll find every endpoint the API can offer.

Stan API has two main features:

- __Stan Connect__: fetch Stan users personnal infos with a OAuth2 standard
- __Stan Payment__: create a Stan payment for Stan user or non Stan users by creating a customer

<Note>
Stan Connect only works with users who installed the Stan Application and subscribed to our services.
</Note>
<Note>
Stan Payment works either with or without the Stan Application.
